Squiggle. This is a blog that I have decided to create, this will be my journal as I delve into the unforeseeable future. 

This blog will just be a compilation of all the things that are on my mind at any given time.

I am currently learning Java programming at the moment and will most likely post a lot of that sort of content, this is my thought bank.

I intend to look back at this blog in 5 years and have a portfolio of all the things I am currently working on.

I may add a comment system to this blog in the future, but for now if you really have something to say, just say [hello]({{ baseurl }}/contact/).
