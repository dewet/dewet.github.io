I am Ben de Wet, a programmer/web developer from the Southern most point of South Africa. This website will be updated frequently with new concepts and ideas for projects that I take part of.

If you would like me to create a website for you or if you would like know what this website is really about, just contact me on ben@dewet.io

This site is still in development and will soon include its very own contact page. but for now, just email me ;)

Thank you!
