This is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) blog created purely for the purpose of spreading my thoughts throughout the internet. I needed a quick and easy way to keep a tab on whats happening in my life at the moment, the content of this blog may vary between programming to mushroom growing and everything else in between.
